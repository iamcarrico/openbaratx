We are a small group of independent Austinites who have been doing South By for years. We have tracked the best events, and keep on top of all the places to enjoy free drinks throughout all of South by Southwest. We focus on both official (badge required) and unofficial parties.

Follow our Twitter account for the most up-to-date information of events during SXSW, where you can find us, and where you should be headed.

### Why are there links to Amazon?

Currently, I pay for this whole site out-of-pocket. Buying any of the products I use helps offset the cost off hosting and development.
