One of the most important parts about your South By prep is RSVPing to the events you want to go to, as well as some backups, before the week starts. There are a lot of really great events that happen every year around South By— and almost every single one of them will require you RSVP in advance. Here are some tips and tricks I use to ensure I get RSVP'd to everything I want to go to.

### Use an email just for South By

I cannot stress this enough— get an email that you will use just for SXSW. Sign up for a new one over at [Gmail](https://gmail.com), and use it to RSVP for everything that week. You will be signed up for a lot of email lists through these RSVPs, and it is easier just to use a secondary account to ensure your own email inbox isn't bogged down. That being said— check the lists you do get signed up for, and see if there are any that interest you. For example, I still read my Fader emails— because I love [The Fader](http://www.thefader.com/).

### Sign up for rsvpster

If you do not want to spend the time RSVPing to everything, just sign up for [rsvpster](http://rsvpster.com/). They do all of the heavy South By RSVP work for you, and will sign you up with all of the super important South By events. It will make your lives 1000x easier that week, and give all the important deets to have fun that week.

### Create accounts

For fast RSVPing to a bunch of events, be sure to create an account with [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/) and [SquadUp](https://www.squadup.com). Both have a bunch of events that go through them, and will make signing up for the many events much, much faster.

### Follow the accounts

I will be publishing a full list of all of the best South By Twitter accounts soon, but make sure to follow these ones right now. Each of them specialize in a specific part of South By prep, and they are all on point.

### Use the hashtag

For all of the tweets I send out for RSVPs, I include the hastag #SXSWrsvp. Look out for it on Twitter, and share any new ones you find with it as well. Let us all help each other getting ready for this great week!
