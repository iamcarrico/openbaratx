South By can be a crazy time, but it is important you have a safe ride home every night. There are many options to get home, from the train, to busses, to cabs, or Lyft/Uber. Make sure you have a plan in place to get home every night.

### Trains, busses, and cabs

CapMetro has a complete listing of their service at their website [capmetro.org](http://www.capmetro.org/)

Call Yellow Cab at [(512) 452-9999](tel:5124529999), or go to their website [yellowcabaustin.com](http://www.yellowcabaustin.com/).

### Free rides on Lyft

We want to make sure you have some easy ways to get home, so we have partnered up with Lyft to give you a free ride when you sign up. Use the code "[SXDRINKS](https://www.lyft.com/invited/SXDRINKS)" to get your first free ride.
