We are all in this togetherâ€” and we have a set of hashtags that we use every year to ensure all of the best South By information is shared. Follow them, use them, keep them in mind.

### #SXSWrsvp

Events that you should RSVP to before South By, or if new RSVPs open up during the week.

### #SXLines

Updates on lines to events, how long waits are, etc.

### #SXFN

Where all the free food is during South By. Also include in this [@SouthByFreeNOMS](httsp://twitter.com/SouthByFreeNOMS)

### #SXDrinks

Where all the free drinks are. My favorite hashtag, and I keep close track to any new events announced here.

### #SXSWTIPS

Any tips or guides shared during South By. Helpful things you, or any of us have found.

### #SXWin

Contests, give-aways, other generally free things you could win before or during SXSW.
