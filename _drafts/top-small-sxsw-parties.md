Not every party at South By are the huge bangers of Fader Fort or The Hype Hotel— some of my favorite events are the smaller shows. All of these are smaller events— or early morning brunches I will stop by for a quick pick-me-up in the morning.

### Dublin Makes Me

I'm not going to lie, I will be here purely to see the incomparable [Dr Panti Bliss](https://twitter.com/PantiBliss). There will be a night of performances, as well as s tradition Irish Wake for the dead startups in the land. I hear there will be Irish whiskey in attendance as well. [RSVP at their site](http://www.startupdublin.com/dublinmakesme/) for attendance.
