The drinks may be free— but the people working the many events of South By are all at work. Do not forget to tip your bartenders appropriately— most of them are working extra long hours this week.

Keep extra $1's (and maybe even some $2's) in your bag to give to bartenders throughout the week. I like to give $1 to every bartender for every drink they make me, as should you.

Keep the free drinks going, be kind to the doorman—
