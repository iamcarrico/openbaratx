I have two rules of South By, and they are words to live by.

1. Don't wait in lines
2. Don't pay for drinks

And the corollary to the second rule: Always tip your bartender.

### Don't wait in lines

There will be a couple of lines throughout the week you have to wait in. I am thinking of the Fader Fort line from last year— but generally speaking very few things is worth waiting in line for. There is so much going on all week, there is always something else going on. If one party has a huge line, check out the next one.

Now, there is also a good amount of FOMO out there. If you are in a great place, having fun— and you hear about another party on the other side of town. It is okay to stay where you are at. Enjoy the party— keep having fun.

### Don't pay for drinks

Last South By— I bought two drinks. Both [@LoneStarBeer](https://twitter.com/LoneStarBeer). And only because there were a few bands that I really wanted to see. 11 days, and Austin had enough going on to keep me well hydrated.

But the corollary, just because the drinks are free, does not mean your bartenders are not working hard. Tip them, $1 for a drink—
