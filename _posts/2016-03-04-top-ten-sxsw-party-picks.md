Every year I get asked what the absolute best parties I think will be. While there are almost too many to choose from— these are the 10 I will most certainly not be missing. Make sure to RSVP to them as soon as you can (links noted below), because this week is going to be AMAZING.

### Fader Fort

One of the best events of South By is coming back as an unofficial event. New this year will be an arcade presented by Toyota. For music, The Fort is refocusing back to discovery— so do not expect any Kanye rumors again. This makes us more excited than anything else, and are ready to see what the fine folks at [@theFader](https://twitter.com/theFader) have in store for us this year. Be sure to follow their Snapchat to find out the full lineup. Back again are some great sponsors— [Converse](http://www.converse.com/us), [Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey](http://www.jackdaniels.com/verify-age), [Toyota Prius](http://www.toyota.com/prius/), [Getty Images](http://www.gettyimages.com/), [Budweiser](http://www.budweiser.com/), and [SiriusXM](http://www.siriusxm.com/).

Read more about what is coming from The Fort on the [Austin360 exclusive](http://music.blog.austin360.com/2016/03/01/exclusive-fader-fort-to-return-as-unofficial-sxsw-week-event-with-transmission-events-producing/). The Fort is again going to be invite-only, and emails to past-attendees should be on their way. Be sure to keep an eye on you email to RSVP.

### Hype Hotel

[Mazda](http://www.mazdausa.com/MusaWeb/displayHomepage.action) and [The Hype Machine](http://hypem.com/) are back with the Hype Hotel. I stopped by here every night to listen to some amazing music— and grab my favorite Texas vodka, [Tito's Handmade Vodka](http://www.titosvodka.com/). Other sponsors this year are [Bud Light](http://www.budlight.com/), [Flip Flop Wines](http://www.flipflopwines.com/), and [Don Julio tequila](http://www.donjulio.com/).

[RSVP over at Hypem](http://hypem.com/hotel/2016/) today, and prepare for some awesome nights at the hotel.

### Spotify House

Not only does [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/) have amazing music and drinks all day long— but they also have partnered up with [Soul Cycle](https://www.soul-cycle.com/) to have cycling class with live DJs in the morning. We will be there— you should be too. Spotify has become a staple of South By, and I'll never forget some of the intimate concerts I have seen there.

### Media Temple

The closing party of [#SXSWi](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23SXSWi) is always the event to be at. This year will have [Big Boi](https://twitter.com/BigBoi) and [St. Lucia](https://twitter.com/stlucia)— as well as an open bar all night. It is for badges only BUT— follow [@mediatemple](https://twitter.com/mediatemple) on Twitter to win some VIP passes that will get you in.

### ATX Startup Crawl

The [ATX Startup Crawl](http://atxstartupcrawl.com) is the unofficial kickoff to the parties of South By. On Thursday night, startups all over Austin open their doors to show off the amazing work that is being done. With mega stops at [Capital Factory](https://capitalfactory.com/), [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/), and others— this will certainly wet your whistle in preparation for South By.
