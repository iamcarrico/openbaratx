There are a host of guides out there for SXSW— this little site being one of them. But I mainly focus on getting you the best drinks for South By, there are many more all-encompassing guides out there that have not just the parties— but bands to watch.

### @SXSWMF / Music Felon

The GO TO guide is most certainly by [@SXSWMF](https://twitter.com/sxswmf). Check out his [SXSW 2016 Unofficial Guide](http://www.musicfelon.com/sxsw-2016-unofficial-guide/) and listen to his amazing [Spotify playlists](http://www.musicfelon.com/sxsw-2016-playlists) that have all of the official bands on them.

### ATX Concert

Clinton of [@atxconcert](https://twitter.com/atxconcert) keeps track of all of the concerts in Austin not just during SXSW, but all throughout the year. He has his guide of the [Top 60 Must-See artists of 2016](https://twitter.com/atxconcert/status/698209264892915712) that are all amazing. Follow his account, and keep up with all he has to say.

### Keegan's List / The Cheat Sheet

Chris Keegan has been keeping a full list of all the parties, and their RSVPs, over at [Keegan's List](https://keeganslistsxsw.wordpress.com/). He has also been working with [@StevieDoes](https://twitter.com/StevieDoes) to have all the best events over at their new account [@CheatSheetATX](https://twitter.com/CheatSheetATX)— and the website [cheatsheetatx.com](www.cheatsheetatx.com).
