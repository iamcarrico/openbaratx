Occasionally we get questions on the types of events that we post to our [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/OpenBarATX), within this site, and on our [calendar](/calendar/). We do not post every event during South By, and have some strict standards on what we post.

### What we do NOT post

We do not post events that we do not believe will have drinks provided, although some events we do post will not always have drinks there. Not every event posts what will be there, although we judiciously look at all the event information— and based on what is shared and past events— we gage what we think will be there.

We also do not publicly post private events, or events that are meant to to be directed at specific groups (e.g. events meant for minority groups or specific business groups). Many of these are during the interactive portion of the festival. Sometimes, we post this events accidentally— but we try to remove them when brought to our attention.

### How to add / remove events from our list

If you want you event included on our list, or want an event taken off our list— just send us an email at [events@openbaratx.com](mailto:events@openbaratx.com). Be sure to include the event information, and any related tweets or other listings you would like for us to post.

We are also happy to provide coverage of your event during the festival when appropriate. Again, just send us an email— and let us know how we can help your event.

### New events during the week

Inevitably, there are small events— or events that were not published prior to the week. We will be sharing those as we learn of them— as well as if you need a badge/RSVP to get in. Make sure to stay tuned to our Twitter account all week to find all the best places to be. Share any events you know to our handle [@OpenBarATX](https://twitter.com/OpenBarATX), and using the hashtag [#sxdrinks](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23sxdrinks).
