This might surprise some folks— but I go to a lot of events during SXSW that do not feature free drinks. There are so many amazing events going around during South By— sometimes it is about the music and the tech. These are the top events that I will be at during South By—

(note: most of these are official events— and will require a badge/wristband at night)

### Spin @ Stubb's

Every year, Spin brings in some amazing bands to play their show at [Stubb's Bar-b-q](http://www.stubbsaustin.com/). This year is no exception, and with bands like [BLEACHED](https://twitter.com/HelloBleached), [Vince Staples](https://twitter.com/vincestaples), and [CHVRCHΞS](https://twitter.com/CHVRCHES) Spin is going to be a great party to be at, and always starts with a healthy Austin brunch of breakfast tacos.

Be sure to [RSVP](http://stubbs.spin.com/) over at their site— and pick up the laminate early.

### Collide on Rainey

[Culture Collide](https://twitter.com/culturecollide) has been absolutely killing it this year with their lineups and events. Wednesday through Saturday they are taking over four bars on Rainey Street, each with their own themes and events. With over 150 bands that will be playing, it will be impossible to list even my favorite ones here.

[Check out the full-lineups and RSVP over at their site](http://www.culturecollide.com/feed/detail/collide_on_rainey_sxsw_2016#.Vts9y5MrJE4). Be sure to RSVP to all four events, and come early. The bars on Rainey are not huge, and are bound to fill up by the early evening.

### Umbel's Data Disco

Do you like [Bloc Party](https://twitter.com/BlocParty)? I love Block Party— and [Umbel](https://www.umbel.com/) is taking over Austin's best music venue for an evening that is certainly going to be not-to-miss. Be sure to [RSVP today](https://datadisco.umbel.com/rsvps/new), and join Umbel at the [Moody Theater](http://acl-live.com/) for a great kickoff for the week.

### Pandora Discovery Den

Four days— four themes. Dance. Americana. Hip Hop / R&B. Rock.

Pick your day, or days, and join [Pandora](http://www.pandora.com/) at their Discovery Den to listen to some great music. One of my favorite SXSW stories comes from the Discovery Den a few years back— where I started listening to this new band whose sound was amazing, in a crowd of maybe 50. This year, [Walk the Moon](http://www.walkthemoonband.com/) absolutely had the crowd going crazy at Austin City Limits. Never doubt what music Pandora brings in. Their [RSVP is up](https://pandoradiscoverydensxsw.splashthat.com/), don't miss out.

### Quantum Collective's Southwest Invasion

Do you ever feel that you have a semi-charmed life? Then you should join the Quantum Collective for three days of live music over at [Whole Foods HQ](http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/). This year's Southwest Invasion will feature [Third Eye Blind](https://twitter.com/ThirdEyeBlind), [Talib Kweli](https://twitter.com/TalibKweli), [Deap Vally](https://twitter.com/DeapVally), [Made of Oak](https://twitter.com/MADEOFOAK), and [MSTRKRFT](https://twitter.com/mstrkrft).

Go [RSVP at eventbrite](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/southwest-invasion-2016-registration-20974653754) for free access to the shows, and pay attention to our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/OpenBarATX) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/OpenBarATX/) feeds— we will be giving away free VIP access to the shows this week.

### FLOODfest

[Flood Magazine](http://floodmagazine.com/) is taking over [Cedar Street Courtyard](http://cedarstreetaustin.com/) for the second year in a row to bring us FLOODfest. While you should [check out the whole lineup](http://floodmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/FLOODfest-All-Artists-v8.png), I am by far most excited to see [Peaches](https://twitter.com/peaches) there. The days shows are open to [RSVP at their website](http://floodmagazine.com/33203/floodfestaustin2016/), although the night shows will require a badge.

### Waterloo Records Day Parties

Every Austin native is familiar with Waterloo Records, and their day parties every year are a great way to spend the afternoon. They always have great lineups, and are usually a pretty chill way to spend the afternoon. It is four days, free, no badges, no RSVP— and all ages are welcome. Most of the bands also have signings after their sets. Check out the lineups [for](http://events.waterloorecords.com/waterloorecordsdaypartydayone2016) [all](http://events.waterloorecords.com/waterloorecordsdaypartydaytwo2016) [four](http://events.waterloorecords.com/waterloorecordsdaypartydaythree2016) [days](http://events.waterloorecords.com/waterloorecordsdaypartydayfour2016), and be ready for a great time.

### South x San Jose

Head on down to South Congress— and check out [Hotel San Jose's](http://www.sanjosehotel.com/) featured event— South x San Jose. Four days of 100% free music, starting at noon every day. [Their full lineup each days is posted](http://www.sanjosehotel.com/events/south-x-san-jose/), no reason not to check out the music.

### British Music Embassy

Why don't you come down to the pub and have a pint with your mates at the British Music Embassy? Filled with musicians from across the pond, the embassy is sure to rock again this year. It is an official venue, so badges are required for some shows— although some shows just need an RSVP to get in. [Their website](http://www.thebritishmusicembassy.com/) has all the information you need.

### House of Vans

With the [full lineup just announced yesterday](https://twitter.com/VANS_66/status/706857565829738496)— the House of Vans at Mohawk is bound to be another great 4 days of great music. You cannot go wrong with spending an afternoon or evening listening to all they have in store. No badge or wristband needed for the day shows, although they will be given priority.
